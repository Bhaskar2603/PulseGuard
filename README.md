# 🌫️ PulseGuard: Wearable Driven Personalized Air Quality Alert System

## 🌫️ Problem Statement
Gurugram's severe air pollution (PM2.5 >180 µg/m³) causes 1.67 million annual deaths in India, yet citizens lack personalized exposure alerts based on location and health status. Traditional air quality monitoring fails to account for individual health profiles and micro-level pollution variations, exacerbating health disparities.

## 🌟 Solution Overview
PulseGuard integrates wearable biometric data with hyperlocal pollution mapping using XGBoost modeling (R² = 0.85) to deliver personalized health risk alerts. The system identifies high-risk zones through ArcGIS spatial analytics for Gurugram residents, empowering citizens to minimize exposure and reduce preventable hospitalizations.

## 📊 Key Features

✅ **Hyperlocal Pollution Prediction**  
- XGBoost model with R² = 0.85 for PM2.5 prediction across 75 Gurugram stations
- Enhanced time-based features (rush hour, weekends, months) improving accuracy by 13%

✅ **Personalized Health Risk Assessment**  
- Risk scoring based on individual health profile (asthma status, age, etc.)
- Amplification factors for vulnerable populations (asthma ×1.5, age >60 ×1.3)

✅ **Spatial Visualization**  
- ArcGIS integration with WHO-aligned risk thresholds (green <75, yellow 75-100, orange 100-150, red >150 µg/m³)
- High-risk zone identification along traffic corridors (NH-8, Cyber City)

✅ **Actionable Recommendations**  
- Route optimization to avoid high-pollution areas
- Real-time mitigation strategies (mask recommendations, activity adjustments)

## 📈 Model Performance

| **Model** | **R²** | **RMSE** | **Key Parameters** |
|-----------|--------|----------|--------------------|
| **XGBoost (Enhanced Features)** | **0.85** | **19.27** | n_estimators=200, max_depth=8, learning_rate=0.05 |

### **Feature Importance**

| **Feature** | **Importance** | **Insight** |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| **month** | 51.02% | Seasonal patterns dominate pollution (Nov: 40% higher than annual avg) |
| **PM10** | 30.18% | Confirms PM10 as key PM2.5 predictor (coarse → fine particulate conversion) |
| **AT** | 6.48% | Temperature inversely affects pollution (higher temp = better dispersion) |
| **is_rush_hour** | 1.99% | Traffic significantly impacts air quality (15-20% PM2.5 increase) |

## 🌍 Spatial Validation

- **High-risk zones** (red) concentrated along NH-8 and Cyber City corridors
- **Sector 15** consistently shows elevated levels (PM2.5 > 130 µg/m³)
- **WHO-aligned color scheme** (green < 75, yellow 75-100, orange 100-150, red > 150 µg/m³)
